var x = 5

var y = "7"


// Write a print statement that combines x + y into the integer value 12

console.log(x+Number(y))

//Write a print statement that combines x + y into the string value 57

// so unlike python, Javascript has type coercion and no need
// to explicitly convert between data types in some cases, example below
console.log(x+y)
